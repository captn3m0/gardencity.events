These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for more incremental changes to applications in production. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid. So, in this rapid and fast world of CI-CD, focusing on highly scalable &amp; highly portable software landscape, which offers high usage oriented web apps, the security landscape has really reached to cutting edge point. This talk, will focus on how to posturize security with this fast pace world, covering most of all security verticals.

Doug Cutting (the Father of Hadoop!) will be talking about \"From MapReduce to Spark: An Ecosystem Evolves\" Abstract: Apache Hadoop was the first software to permit affordable use of petabytes. In the decade since, many other projects have been created around Hadoop's HDFS storage layer and its MapReduce processing engine, forming a rich software ecosystem. Apache Spark now provides a second generation processing engine which greatly improves on Hadoop's MapReduce. Most new applications will now use Spark in place of MapReduce. This transition provides an example of an evolutionary pattern in the data ecosystem that gives it long-term strength. Ted Dunning, Chief Architect at MapR ,Guru of Everything Scalable, Co-Author of Mahout in Action and Noted Beer Drinker. \"How Document Databases Simplify Database Design\" He will walk though how a real world database can be restructured using nested data structures resulting in a much simpler design that achieves high performance and scalability and is much easier to understand than the original. In addition, He will show how the resulting database can be queried using SQL tools such as Apache Drill, or using API’s in Python, Javascript and Java.

His current focus at LinkedIn includes all things Hadoop, high-performance distributed OLAP engines, large-scale data ingestion, transformation and movement, and data lineage and discovery. • Wes McKinney is a software engineer at Cloudera and lead developer of Ibis. He is the creator of Python’s pandas library and is the author of Python for Data Analysis. Previously, Wes was the founder and CEO of DataPad. •  Jennifer Marsman is a principal developer evangelist in Microsoft’s Developer and Platform Evangelism group, where she educates developers on Microsoft’s new technologies.

Prior to becoming a developer evangelist, Jennifer was a software developer in Microsoft’s Natural Interactive Services division. In this role, she earned two patents for her work in search and data mining algorithms. Tech Startup Lightning Talks: Bin Fan is a software engineer at Tachyon Nexus. He is one of the top committers in the open source community of Tachyon project. Prior to Tachyon Nexus, he worked in Google to build the core storage infrastructure and won Google’s Technical Infrastructure award. Bin got his PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. Talk details: Introduction to Memory-centric Distributed Storage System Tachyon and Its Use Case Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark and Shark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads. To address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Tachyon as an open-source system has more than 160 contributors from over 50 institutions, including IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, Baidu, and Tachyon Nexus. In the presentation, we will also explore several potential industry use cases enabled by the new features.  Fangjin Yang is a co-author of the open source Druid project and a co-founder of Imply, a data analytics startup based in San Francisco. Previously, he held senior engineering positions at Metamarkets and Cisco Systems. Fangjin holds a BASc in Electrical Engineering and a MASc in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada.  Arshak Navruzyan has served in product management and engineering leadership roles at Argyle Data, Alpine Data Labs, Endeca, and Oracle. He is a contributor to the Apache Accumulo project and the organizer of the San Francisco Machine Learning Meetup group.

If a website fails to deliver a satisfactory customer experience the entire value delivery chain is broken, and a company will not generate revenue regardless of product quality or value proposition.Mastering digital performance is one of the leading challenges of the web economy, and requires a joint effort between IT and the lines of business. It means measuring and managing the end-to-end transaction delivery and translating it into actionable information. Ultimately user experience is your best success metric. If you’re not proactively addressing digital performance issues, users are more likely to take their complaints to their social streams than to call-in and report it.
